# code-prr

matklad's VS Code extension for most excellent https://github.com/danobi/prr

## Status

This is code I've written for myself. I have no intention of publishing this as a proper extension.
I will be delighted if someone forks this, or just writes a proper extension from scratch so that I
don't have to do it.

## Installation

Only from source

```console
$ npm install
$ npm run install-extension
```

## Features

- rudimentary syntax highlighting
- folding for .prr files
